What's in the dataset:

\Images\
The "Images" folder has photos of the conversational group that has been taken roughly every second. The name of the file is the "frame number" followed by the time that the image was taken.  (e.g., "1687 2019-25-9--18-04-44.jpeg" means that the frame number is 1687 and the photo is taken on 2019/25/9 at 18:04:44)

The "frame number" is useful for accessing the position and orientation of people in the conversational group.

corrupted images: #26,3460,3461,3462,3463
